Tools for turn-based games sites like Yucata, Boite, BG Arena, etc.

## Directory and file layout
At least this is coming together for A Few Acres of Snow. Should probably 
match for other Yucata games.

### <game_name>

Should match the Yucata URL.

- `ROAD_MAP.md`: Where to put ideas.

### <game_name>/games

Both my own and others (generally the best players). If stored as Javascript
use standard .js extension. For use with tests or as production input 
for my own analysis.

### <game_name>/site

Source code taken from the site for help with analysis. Notes on same.
