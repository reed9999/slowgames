The first interesting elements are naturally the top row indicators of things like fortresses left:

<img id="fortDisc" alt="" src="/netimages/games/FewAcresOfSnow/fortDisc.png" ...>

Then a div called oppDiv with the opponent's dashboard. oppInfoDummy is the size of the discard pile, but naturally
we care more about the contents that appear when we click it.

We can go to Listeners (at the bottom) | click and see that this line 1 column 151358, or pretty line 4255.
arrayShuffle()
If I click I get an element called cardInfoDiv. This appears to be the name for Discard, Hand, etc.

Not sure the debugger is in the right place -- arrayShuffle looks like it just shuffles the cards. What about instead

See the bundle
SetHistoryMove() 3568
InitBoard() 3436
CancelMove() 3370
UserGiveUp() 3364

Let's dig in the general bundle.

Actually it turns out InitBoard() is more often called from $(document).ready, line 804 of the HTML.

ShowLastMoveInfo() 3653 of beautified is probably more salient.
The big case statement at 3723 is where the weird characters are used.
Decode() is just return n.charCodeAt(t) - 176.
So there you go. That's the offset into this weird world.

Knowing the 176 offset, the case statement is easy to unwind. I'll just put it in the code.
